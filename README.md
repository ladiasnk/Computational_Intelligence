# Computational_Intelligence
This is a repo containing all of my assignments regarding my university course of Computational Intelligence. All of the reports about each assignment's findings and conclusions as well as the analysis required are written in Greek. The repo contains assignments about:
* Assignment 1: Speed control of a work table mechanism with fuzzy controllers. The work includes design of a linear and fuzzy controller with the SImulink environment, as well as analysis and annotation of the responses of the generated system to various inputs.
* Assignment 2: Solving regression problems using TSK models. Training and evaluation of TSK models using the MATLAB environment, application to high dimensionality datasets.
* Asssignment 3: Solving classification problems using Multi-Layer Perceptron network. Investigate model performance for different design and training techniques. Fine tuning of network.
* Assignment 4: Solving regression problems using Radial-Basis Function network. Implementation of Fine tuning of the network.
